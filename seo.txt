Technical SEO Checklist
XML Sitemap & Indexing: Generate an XML sitemap listing all important URLs (one per tool and main landing page). Submit the sitemap via Google Search Console to ensure Google discovers and indexes every page
developers.google.com
. Use absolute canonical URLs in the sitemap
developers.google.com
. If the site grows, consider a sitemap index. Also ensure a robots.txt file does not block any tool pages.
Crawlability: Verify all pages are crawlable (no unwanted noindex tags) and load correctly. Check Search Console’s Coverage report for any indexing errors.
Core Web Vitals: Aim for good Core Web Vitals scores on all pages
developers.google.com
:
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): under 2.5 seconds
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) (formerly FID): under 200 ms
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): below 0.1
Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to measure and optimize these metrics. For example, optimize and compress images, minify CSS/JS, and ensure quick server response times to improve LCP. Reduce unnecessary third-party scripts for better INP, and set explicit size attributes on images/elements to avoid layout shifts (CLS).
Mobile-Friendliness: Ensure a responsive design so content (clocks, tools) displays well on mobile devices
developers.google.com
. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning the mobile version of each page is considered for ranking. Test pages with Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test and fix any issues (readability, viewport settings, touch-targets). Keep navigation and H1/H2 headings consistent on mobile.
Page Speed & Performance: Prioritize fast loading: leverage browser caching, compress text resources (GZIP/Brotli), and serve scaled images. Use a CDN like Cloudflare to deliver assets globally and reduce latency. Cloudflare caching notably speeds up content delivery without negative SEO impact
developers.cloudflare.com
. Also ensure the site uses HTTPS (Google considers it a ranking factor
developers.cloudflare.com
) and HTTP/2 if possible.
Caching and CDN: Implement server-side and client-side caching. For static assets (images, scripts, CSS), set long cache lifetimes. Cloudflare (or similar) can further cache static content at edge locations, improving load times worldwide. Cloudflare’s caching won’t harm SEO and can improve rankings by boosting speed
developers.cloudflare.com
. Use features like “Always Online” to serve cached content during outages.
Schema Implementation: As noted above, add structured data (JSON-LD) for each tool (SoftwareApplication) and the site. Use [SoftwareApplication] schema for each free tool page with relevant fields (name, description, URL, image if applicable, offer price). This may enable rich results. Also consider a global Organization schema (with site name, logo) on the main page, and BreadcrumbList if there is breadcrumb navigation (helps Google understand site structure).
Google Search Console: Confirm each site and subdomain is added and verified in Google Search Console. Submit the sitemap there and monitor for errors or warnings (coverage, mobile usability, Core Web Vitals). Check performance reports to see impressions/clicks for target keywords and adjust content/metadata if needed. Use the URL Inspection tool to test indexing.
Google Analytics 4: Ensure GA4 tracking is set up on all pages (including cross-domain if tools run on subdomains). GA4 provides insights on user behavior, bounce rates, and conversion events (e.g. tool uses). Link GA4 with Search Console to combine data. (Note: GA4 is now standard; if only Universal Analytics was used, migrate to GA4.) Confirm the analytics code is present and collecting data properly.
Accessibility and Alt Text: Add descriptive, keyword-relevant alt text to all images (especially screenshots or illustrative images) as shown above
developers.google.com
. This improves image SEO and accessibility. Ensure all pages have meaningful titles and descriptive anchor text for links.
Monitoring & Maintenance: Plan for regular content reviews. Keep meta tags and structured data up to date if site content changes. Use Search Console to track any new index issues. Regularly review Core Web Vitals to catch regressions. Update tools and pages as needed based on user feedback and search performance.
By following this 30-day SEO plan, each tool page will be optimized for its target keyword and user intent, and the site’s technical foundation will support strong search performance. Quality content with natural keyword use (as in the samples above), coupled with technical best practices (sitemaps, Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, and schema), will help Kavzorn’s tools rank effectively and attract more organic users
